# Welcome to Spree Sort Products

Spree Sort Products extends the ability of a taxon on its products to be sorted from the web interface using the drag and drop behavior.

Here is a quick walk through of sorting products using this extension: [Click here to see the steps](https://github.com/suryart/spree_sort_products/wiki/sort-products)

## Installation

### Inside your rails application with Spree installed include the following line in your Gemfile:
  * Get the latest greatest from github: 
    
      ```ruby
        gem 'jquery-dragsort-rails', '~> 1.0.0'
        gem 'spree_sort_products' , :git => 'git://github.com/suryart/spree_sort_products.git'
      ```

  * Get the 2-3-stable branch for Spree 2.3.x from github: 
    
      ```ruby
        gem 'jquery-dragsort-rails', '~> 1.0.0'
        gem 'spree_sort_products' , :git => 'https://github.com/mejuri-inc/spree_sort_products', :branch => '2-3-stable'
      ```

  * Or get it from rubygems.org by mentioning the following line in your Gemfile:
    
      ```ruby 
        gem 'jquery-dragsort-rails', '~> 1.0.0'
        gem 'spree_sort_products', '2.0.0'
      ```

### Then run the following commands: 

    $ bundle install
    $ rails g spree_sort_products:install 
    $ rake db:migrate
    $ rails s 
    

Please note that this extension uses [jquery-dragsort-rails](https://github.com/suryart/jquery-dragsort-rails) to achieve 3D sorting.

## Caution

Just make sure that you have **admin/taxon_tree_menu_overrides** and **admin/sort_products** files precompiled. If it's not happening by default then please add/edit this in your **config/environments/production.rb** file:

        Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w(admin/taxon_tree_menu_overrides admin/sort_products)

## TODOs

* Write test cases.

## Testing

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake test_app
bundle exec rspec spec
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_sort_products/factories'
```
